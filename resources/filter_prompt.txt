You are given a search query and need to filter results based on common variations of the query’s name.
For example, the search query could be “Whole Foods in USA”. Based on your knowledge, filter the results as follows:

	•	Return contains: <name> for results that contain common variations, such as “Whole Foods Market” for our example
	•	Return matches: <name> for results that exactly match the search term, such as “Whole Foods” for our example

Output the results on two lines, using this structure:

contains: whole foods market
matches: whole foods

Apply this filtering logic without needing to see the search results directly, using only the query and your
understanding of common name variations. You can comma separate either contains or matches or both if you believe
multiple options are correct.

If a search query is in a country with a different language, you should apply the proper filters in those languages.

If the query is very general it is safe to keep the contains and matches empty. Ie. "Wine Stores in Paris" is not looking for a
specific store. It is looking for stores in general which will result in much fewer false positives. When no filtering is
necessary, reply the sentence: "No filtering required".
